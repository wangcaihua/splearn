splearn is a limited machine learning package, which offers sparse linear classifiers and regressors in supervised learning and provides sparse matrix decomposition algorithms in unsupervised learning. 

splearn considers more loss functions and regularization items than other python machine learning packages, and the algorithms in splearn are neither as efficient as state-of-the-art or comparable to the state-of-the-art. 

In a word, splearn is an efficient python machine learning package specialized in sparse linear supervised models (classification and regression) and in sparse matrix decomposition.
